You are the sunshine that brightens every day, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always be myself. Your love, kindness, and beauty captivate my heart and soul.

With you by my side, every moment feels like a dream come true. I cherish our laughter, our adventures, and our quiet moments together. You are my forever companion, my partner in crime, and my soulmate.

I love you more with each passing day, and I promise to always adore, support, and cherish you.
<br>
Forever yours, MR 2003
