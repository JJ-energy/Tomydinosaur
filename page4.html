        <p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; color: #000;">We've been through hell and back, Gabby. All the bullshit, the arguments, the tears... but despite it all, we're still standing. Still loving, still fighting, still holding on.

No matter how far apart we are, no matter how long it takes until we're in each other's arms again, know this: my love for you will never waver. It's the anchor that holds me, the fire that burns within me.

When my arms can't hold you, my prayers will. When the distance feels overwhelming, know that I'm praying for you, for us, for our love to continue to flourish.
<br>
I love you, Gabby. Now and forever.
